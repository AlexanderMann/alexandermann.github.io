  The last 7 months have been awesome. Here's looking forward to the next one 🙇

  The last 7 months talking and collaborating with you all have truly been a
  highlight of my career. There's a lot to come, but wanted to give a small
  token of my thanks to each of you.

  I'm moving, I have a <i>bunch</i> of random stickers laying around. It's a
