  <strong>Hello</strong> and happy holidays! Gather round for a tale of
  2017…
</p>

<p>
  <strong>At</strong> the outset of the year I found myself celebrating
  around beloved friends, old and new, in India. I had just experienced
  Hong Kong for Christmas and an anniversary at a nude spa in Germany. All
  of this rolled into a wonderful series of weddings throughout the year
  (seven to close it out).

<p>
  <strong>Back</strong> in Philly I found myself harangued into biking
  across Pennsylvania...in under 40 hours...a total of 385mi/600k. I still
  have nerve damage in my hands and feet. 10/10 would do again, many
  thanks to DayMann cycling for the…”encouragement”.

  <strong>In</strong> June Jules and I moved to Milwaukee Wisconsin to be
  “closer” to Natalie. I am still convinced the move was only so that she
  would not longer have to cook for herself and would have readily
  available access to the dog. This year she has participated in a number
  of high profile conferences and think tanks. She’s so smart.
</p>

</p>

<p>
  <strong>Thus</strong> far Milwaukee has been wonderful. Kind people,
  good friends, amazing tacos, copious beer, something going on every
  weekend. I’ve been fortunate enough to have fallen in with various
  creative types and climbers so it seems like I’m constantly learning. I
  also started mentoring a “little brother” through Big Brothers Big
  Sisters. Kids are ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>In</strong> October I found out that Natalie gets seasick while
  we were en route to my mother’s wedding in Nova Scotia. I now have three
  new brothers and sisters. I do not think any of them are ready for my
  brothers and I. Susan continues to embarrass and amaze us all. She is in
  her last year of her second graduate degree. Her apple pies are still
  delicious.

<p>
  <strong>Both</strong> brothers continue to do extremely well in life.
  Bryan is in his final year at Georgia Tech, while Charley gets ready to
  step out into the real world. Bryan’s jobs are starting to require more
  state secrets (a fact he would totally never mention while around dinner
  to impress anyone) and his clothing is starting to match his car: too
  small and expensive. Charley is playing Ultimate Frisbee, designing a
  role playing drinking game, and helping area refugees in Atlanta. His
  life is a healthy balance of ridiculous and compassionate.

<p>
  <strong>Everyday</strong> I realize how privileged I am to be surrounded
  by caring, driven, brilliant individuals. My family and friends are far
  too kind and thus continue to put up with my antics.
</p>
<p>
  Much love from this corner of the world! To my friends, you know who you
  are.
</p>

<p>
  Cheers,<br />
  Alex
