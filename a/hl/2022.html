        <strong>2022</strong>. Well, this isn't coming out in 2022. I'm writing to you from here
        in the future, of January 2023. I didn't much feel like writing when my usual  time rolled
        around (more on that in a sec), but I am still happy to have found the time to do this
        tradition for myself. It's a nice reflective thing that I've inherited from my mother and
        her mother. I find as I get older I'm taking on more and more traits of those I love, intentionally.
        Holding onto pieces of folks as mementos, cherishing little turns of phrase or habits.
        I wish my body weren't also taking up this tradition, but hey, I have my grandfather's hairy
        tragus and that's a thing now.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>A few years back</strong> I wrote a <a href="./2020.html#a-petite-list">list of charities</a>
        that you might consider donating too based on my perceived ills in the world. Please, as always,
        consider supporting the community around you more. You're probably more blessed than you know.

      <p>
        <strong>Natalie</strong> is probably a PhD Candidate now! We are saying "probably"
        because technically she hasn't heard back from her panel on this yet...but they all
        keep treating her as if she's a candidate, so "probably". Most of her news relates
        to writing, and applying to many many fellowships around the country. There's a
        strong chance we'll be bothering a city near you soon!

        <strong>Mom and Tom</strong> are having the time of their lives as usual. Mother
        Susan now lives in Montreal full time, and is fully "installed" as minister at
        St. Andrew's, St. John's. We almost had all all of the extended siblings there,
        and most significant others! My in laws Jim and Donna, even my Aunt and
        Uncle Buck were able to attend. Made for a really lovely family reunion, and we
        got to embarass my mother properly in front of her congregation. Tom will be
        going on sabatical soon to finish some writing, and we're all looking forward to
        getting to spend more time with him.

        <strong>Bryan</strong> was joined by his girlfriend for our family gathering in Montreal.
        Her name is Bryn, and he's made every vain joke imaginable to keep ahead of the rest of
        us. He's going to be the best man in multiple weddings this next year, and to those
        who've entrusted him with this great task, I can only say: you could not have chosen a
        better friend.

        <strong>Charley</strong> made some waves this year and now lives in Philadelphia with
        his long term girlfriend. Still up to his usual antics, when we asked him about the
        most memorable things in his new home town, he gave me a run down of his new friends...
        namely the folks who work at a family owned ice cream shop next to his house. We were
        blessed with his presense at our holiday party where I gave him one simple task: "make
        sure Natalie's glass is never empty". Natalie has banned this for next year.

            The Little Brother
          </a>
        </strong> has an exciting new chapter in his life stretching out in front of him. This fall,
        he and his family moved to Phoenix Arizona! We're still keeping in touch, but a bit
        more remotely than normal. His love of all things anime is proving to be an
        easy bond for us.

        <strong>Jules</strong> has had...not the best year, objectively. Our little purebred doggo has
        proven that simply <i>knowing</i> that your genetic pool is narrow, makes you more prone to
        fun things like cancer with tumors on your face. Taking it in stride, Jules now has a villanous
        scar running from snoot to her eyeball, and her lip now has, medically speaking, an "Elvis curl".
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Till next year,</strong> be of good courage, and know you are loved.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Cheers</strong>,</br>
