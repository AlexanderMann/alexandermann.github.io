  <strong>2022</strong>. Well, this isn't coming out in 2022. I'm writing to you from here
  in the future, of January 2023. I didn't much feel like writing when my usual time rolled
  around (more on that in a sec), but I am still happy to have found the time to do this
  tradition for myself. It's a nice reflective thing that I've inherited from my mother and
  her mother. I find as I get older I'm taking on more and more traits of those I love, intentionally.
  Holding onto pieces of folks as mementos, cherishing little turns of phrase or habits.
  I wish my body weren't also taking up this tradition, but hey, I have my grandfather's hairy
  tragus and that's a thing now.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>A few years back</strong> I wrote a <a href="./2020.html#a-petite-list">list of charities</a>
  that you might consider donating to based on my perceived ills in the world. Please, as always,
  consider supporting the community around you more. You're probably more blessed than you know.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>One</strong> of the things I did manage to do consistently in 2021 was daily
  drawings. Every day, I'd do a little doodle. In 2022,
  <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/SkEjYySkArEiFFyU7">I shared all these.</a>

<p>
  <strong>In</strong> 2022 I managed to train for a big bike ride, and get Covid the week
  of the race. More or less fully recovered from that, and onto the next thing. Highlights of
  the year include:
  <ul>
    <li>
      A trip to Newfoundland Labrador to visit some dear friends. Got to ride skidoos,
      ice fish, and get duped into cross country skiing an olympic level course...I am
      very bad at cross country skiing (had a blast of course, but I will never let
      this person live this down)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.riverwest24.com/">Riverwest24</a> with the best team anyone
      could ever hope for. Stayed up all night, hit almost every check point, did my
      volunteer shift helping prep and provide breakfast for everyone (this maybe
      brought me the most joy...), dance party, blast.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wedding celebrations, friends in drag, great food, truly amazing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Built out that team I was assigned to manage at Apollo. Hired every person on
      the team. Couldn't be prouder of those folks...(more on this in a sec)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.alxmnn.com/a/pizza/2022.html">
        Nother year of biking to Sheboygan to get pizza
      </a>. So many bugs. So little water. So much chaos.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lots of friends, new dishes, bikes. Pretty stellar year.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Annnnnnnnnnnd in December, what put me in a pensive state of mind was a bout of
  layoffs at Apollo. I had honestly not seen this coming, though with the reflection
  and looking back over my journaling, my hind brain certainly <i>had</i> seen
  it coming. That team I managed to build out was disbanded, and many of the folks
  I managed were let go. It was a gutting experience and one I can say with much
  confidence, I have grown from.

</p>

<p>
  <strong>Natalie</strong> is probably a PhD Candidate now! We are saying "probably"
  because technically she hasn't heard back from her panel on this yet...but they all
  keep treating her as if she's a candidate, so "probably". Part way through the year,
  she heard back from the Attingham Trust that there was a last minute opening for
  their prestigious summer course. This is a big deal in the curatorial field, and involves
  dozens of historical estate and museum visits all over England. Mainly, it meant we
  got a month apart from each other. Absence and the heart and whatnot.
  Most of her other news relates to writing, and applying to many many
  fellowships around the country. There's a strong chance we'll be bothering a
  city near you soon! Oh, she also learned how to drive a backhoe...

</p>

<p>
  <strong>Mom and Tom</strong> are having the time of their lives as usual. Mother
  Susan now lives in Montreal full time, and is fully "installed" as minister at
  St. Andrew's, St. John's. We almost had all all of the extended siblings there,
  and most significant others! My in laws Jim and Donna, even my Aunt and
  Uncle Buck were able to attend. Made for a really lovely family reunion, and we
  got to embarass my mother properly in front of her congregation. Tom will be
  going on sabatical soon to finish some writing, and we're all looking forward to
  getting to spend more time with him.

<p>
  <strong>My</strong> Aunt Barb and Uncle Buck even got us down to Georgia for
  Thanksgiving this year at their sprawling compound. If you can't tell from the
  number of photos included from there in this letter, we all had a wonderful time
  and there was truly something for everyone there.

</p>

<p>
  <strong>Bryan</strong> was joined by his girlfriend for our family gathering in Montreal.
  Her name is Bryn, and he's made every vain joke imaginable to keep ahead of the rest of
  us. He's going to be the best man in multiple weddings this next year, and to those
  who've entrusted him with this great task, I can only say: you could not have chosen a
  better friend...brace your liver. While at our family Thanksgiving, he and Charley found
  ample opportunity to prep for their upcoming album drop.

</p>

<p>
  <strong>Charley</strong> made some waves this year and now lives in Philadelphia with
  his long term girlfriend, Ashley. Still up to his usual antics, when we asked him about the
  most memorable things in his new home town, he gave me a run down of his new friends...
  namely the folks who work at a family owned ice cream shop next to his house. We were
  blessed with his presense at our holiday party where I gave him one simple task: "make
  sure Natalie's glass is never empty". Natalie has banned this for next year.

  <strong>
    <a href="http://www.bbbsmilwaukee.org/">
      The Little Brother
    </a>
  </strong> has an exciting new chapter in his life stretching out in front of him. This fall,
  he and his family moved to Phoenix Arizona! We're still keeping in touch, but a bit
  more remotely than normal. His love of all things anime is proving to be an
  easy bond for us.

</p>

<p>
  <strong>Jules</strong> has had...not the best year, objectively. Our little purebred doggo has
  proven that simply <i>knowing</i> that your genetic pool is narrow, makes you more prone to
  fun things like cancer with tumors on your face. Taking it in stride, Jules now has a villainous
  scar running from snoot to her eyeball, and her lip now has, medically speaking, an "Elvis curl".
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Till next year,</strong> be of good courage, and know you are loved.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Cheers</strong>,</br>
