<p>
  <strong>Welcome to our 2024 Holiday letter!</strong> Yes, “our”. Not “Alex’s”. For the first time, in the series of these rambling, meandering, blathering recounts of one man’s journey from madness into nothingness, there is a guest writer. Mrs. Natalie Wright.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>And with that,</strong> I’ll let her take it away for a few of our life updates…

  <strong>The “Mrs.”</strong> part of “Mrs. Natalie Wright” <a href="https://www.alxmnn.com/a/hl/2020.html">became <em>officially</em> official on January 26, 2024</a>. Alex and I got married in the beautiful historic Chateau Montebello. Being surrounded by friends and family to celebrate our relationship felt like being washed over with a wave of love. We are so grateful to everyone who made it and who continues to support us in this lifelong journey.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The weekend</strong> included the ceremony, which Alex’s mum officiated, a reception with lovely speeches in between dinner courses capped off with homemade cake, and boardgames around Montebello’s famous fireplace. It wouldn’t have been a proper Canadian wedding without the curling tournament, too. We were amazed and delighted to hear that some of our best friends said, “if we could relive one weekend again in our lives it would be Natalie and Alex’s wedding.” Let it be known that not only do they have a wedding of their own but also the birth of their daughter as other contenders. They might have had more fun than we did (kidding—slightly). We hope to throw more parties in the future that get everyone back together to rekindle the magic.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Alex and I</strong> are doing well one-year (<em>Alex's note 📓: or 4…or 12</em>) in and now have weekly “state of the union” drinks to discuss relationship goals. Let us know if you have any submissions to our anonymous suggestion box. As a good friend said recently, “intimacy is fortunate, but not accidental.”

  <strong>Work for me (Natalie)</strong> is situation usual. I still have my office at the Smithsonian and am plugging away at the dissertation. Last year the big outcome was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1h_JaL90Lqg?si=Ns8KELlqj6m9WnUZ&amp;t=3486">a lecture</a> that I delivered in the SAAM auditorium in May. Besides that, I got…sidetracked…by writing other publications. If you’d like to peruse the ones that are already out, here are some links:

</ul>
<p>
  <strong>If you’d</strong> like to ask me how progress is going on my dissertation, just know that I’ll ask you an equally “mean” question in return. The end goal is still to turn it into a book which I am declaring here to make it happen.</p>

  <strong>While</strong> Natalie’s work hasn’t changed much, Alex’s has! We joked that he can now cash in his AARP benefits because after three years of being a manager, he became a <strong>senior</strong> manager. He has shown amazing leadership in the company and I’m so glad that his talents are being recognized and rewarded. In reality, he had been doing the job of senior manager for quite some time—from managing multiple teams to doing way, way, way more interviews than anyone else. The CEO’s reaction to the news is telling: “wasn’t he already a senior manager”?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>We</strong> can only hope that the transition from 2024 to 2025 is as smooth as Alex’s into this new position.

  <strong>Our favourite furry friend</strong> is living the high life here in DC. She has the various shops she knows, namely the ones that give her treats (Ginkgo Gardens, Frager’s Hardware, Nothing Fancy Coffee, etc. etc.). She’s well liked by our human neighbours, and even has a puppy on our block who thinks she’s pretty great. Her health is good enough for a 10 year old lady. We love her so much.

<p>
  <strong>Alex again.</strong> In September, we took a few weeks to tour around eastern Spain, south of Barcelona. We were brought to the area by our dear friends’ wedding near Santa Oliva. Ahead of the wedding, we toured Tarragona during their annual Santa Tecla festivals.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Before our trip,</strong> Natalie declared that she was “done with travel planning” (10 minutes into the process), and just wanted “someone to do it who knew her perfectly, and could make recommendations she would trust.”
</p>
<p>
  <strong>So,</strong> I fired up ChatGPT, and had it put together what turned into one of our best trips to date. Just so many magical moments that could not be planned. Whether it was landing in amongst the aforementioned Santa Tecla festival by chance. Or our getting a seat at an amazing, upscale restaurant in Tarragona with no prior reservation, the night we arrived. Or, that same restaurant having a window balcony seat. OR that same balcony seat having a 7 year old go walking by at eye level as we were introduced to the Catalonian tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castell">Castells</a>. Absolutely. Incredible.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Our friends’</strong> wedding was a weekend of continually meeting new best friends, and lamenting that you would now need to tell your old best friends, from 10 seconds ago, the news. The food was incredible, and the dancing was just too much fun. We stayed in the region for about a week afterwards. Fortunately, in that time, our wedding gift arrived: life size busts of the couple.

<p>
  <strong>Annnnnd shortly thereafter, we were off to Hawaii</strong> for a family wedding (we were originally invited to another wedding in Hawaii earlier in the year, but we had to skip as it was truly just too much travel (we love you Matt and Joy!)).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Our first time in Maui,</strong> we were surrounded by family, causing a ruckus at the hotel pools (5 infinity pools to be precise, maybe the nicest hotel Nat and I have ever stayed at?). We did a sunrise volcano hike, explored lava fields, and even spent about 20 minutes hanging out with an octopus while snorkeling. It was amazingly fun to share these adventures with family. And Casey and Mark’s wedding couldn’t have been more beautiful. It was at their wedding that we sort of became the “fan” people since we came with our own props. It was also then that Natalie decided cigars are fun but too much to finish all in one sitting.

<h2 id="halloween">Halloween</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Last year</strong> we updated you on our Halloween decorations of a full size t-rex skull. Not wanting to be outdone by our past selves…we built the rest of the t-rex this year. This was quite an operation, and we are grateful to the friends who came by to help.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Our extinction installation</strong> made it into a few local news blogs, and everyone’s hearts (thankfully also our landlords’). In fact, many neighbours wanted us to leave it up all year-round. But alas, all good things must come to an end. Or at least be reused. In this case, we used pieces from the dinosaur tail, legs, and the frame holding it up, to create a nice little wood rack for our back patio. Now Alex can keep Natalie and Jules extra cozy into the new year.
