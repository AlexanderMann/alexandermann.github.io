  <strong>2021</strong> now heads behind us, 2022 approaches ever faster. Writing this
  from a snowy winter wonderland in Quebec, amidst the Omicron outbreak, I can only
  express my sincere emotional confusion about 2021...many many happy moments, many
  many not, all nesteled amongst a backdrop of feeling like neither is even remotely
  appropriate.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Last</strong> year I wrote about a few of the ills befalling the world,
  and felt like I had really covered the bases. Of course though, 2021 really went
  above and beyond finding ever more ways to make us all worry, about the most basic
  of things. So, instead of a focus on the backdrop of bs we all just went through,
  let me take you on a little read of highlights of my family's year...that being
  said, it's not like any of the the <a href="./2020.html#a-petite-list">things I
  listed last year</a> have really gotten that much better, and apparently we need
  to toss the
  <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">collapse</a>
  <a href="https://naacp.org/">of</a>
  <a href="https://www.lwv.org/">democracy</a>
  into the mix of things to worry about, and omicron, did I mention omicron
  yet?...sorry, done now.

  <strong>This</strong> past year my brothers and I held a funeral for my
  father Lee. We had a lovely turnout of friends and family in our hometown.
  The three of us have grown ever closer, and I am amazed at how loving and
  supportive we can be to one another.

  <strong>I</strong> feel like on the whole I had a pretty positive year. I
  got in my "big adventure" as usual, this year it being a
  <a href="https://www.rideacrosswisconsin.com/">long bike ride,</a>
  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Dozen_(bicycle_competition)">a
  lot of training for it.</a>
  My birthday even featured a short ride to go pick up pizza on the other side of
  the state. <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/">The company I work for</a>
  moved me into management, so I am now a part of the bourgeoisie. We also reached
  <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210817005374">"unicorn" satus,</a>
  with the company itself getting a favorable valuation.

<p>
  <strong>Natalie</strong> is the proud new owner of...A GREENCARD! We started the
  process last year during lockdown, and finihed our interviews late this year. It's
  meant that we've been able to travel to Canada and see family, and in general worry
  a little less about what visa status things look like. In 2021 she has also: been a
  domestique (cycling thing, which is also called a SAG (support-and-gear) but she
  hates being called "the SAG lady", which would be really a shame if folks found out
  abot that),
  <a href="https://cdmc.wisc.edu/2021/08/30/the-politics-at-home-exhibit-an-origin-story/">
    curated another show
  </a>, praised Jesus that Giuseppe won (though she was probably more a JÃ¼rgen girl),
  and wrapped up the course work requirement for her PhD.

<p>
  <strong>Mom and Tom</strong> were able to come celebrate their Birthday with us
  in Madison this year. We also went to New Brunswick for American Thanksgiving to
  celebrate with them. We were very fortunate to welcome another member to our family
  this year! My step-brother John and his wife Cali have an adorable baby girl Leigha.
  My step-sister Ellie is actively interviewing for a professor-ship, we are all wishing
  her the best. All the nieces and nephews are grand. The last big news is that my
  mum Susan, is going to be moving to Montreal! She's going to be working for the Church
  of St. Andrew & St. Paul. This is a huge accomplishment, and we're all very excited
  for this new adventure.

  <strong>Bryan</strong> has new toys, and the same look. We had the fortune
  of visiting him in DC this past year and enjoying his company, cooking, and
  local fare. The three brothers did a group trip to New River Gorge for a rafting
  outing. There were only some mild attempts to throw each other in.

<p>
  <strong>Charley's</strong> 2021, from the outside looking in, seems like it
  went stellarly (sp? Is that even a word?). His job in Pittsburgh is going well,
  he has a nice apartment, he's picked up a few hobbies (whittling/woodcarving, and
  gardening), he is in a positve relationship, and his sense of style is still
  strong. For his birthday, we got him a Dim Sum cooking class in Pittsburgh. It
  featured special guests, Mom and Tom, and was run by...a yinz'er.

    <a href="http://www.bbbsmilwaukee.org/">
      The Little Brother
    </a>
  </strong> is still as goofy as ever. He, Nat, and I have been enjoying various
  anime together. We got to attend a playoff game for the Bucks in the "Deer
  District". We went to a LEGO convention in Milwaukee, and have spent many many
  many nights grappling with fractions/ratios/x/y/z...He also found this past
  year to have a deep love for Chinese food. One of the highlights of my year
  was watching him try Orange Chicken (the true introductory food) for the first
  time.

  <strong>Oh Shit!</strong> Right! Jules! How could one forget?! I left you waiting
  a whole year for her DNA test results. For those of you who guessed "well obviously
  this street dog from Philadelphia is purebred", turns out, you're very right. Jules
  is 10,000% purebred American Staffordshire Terrier. She has not let this go to her
  head.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Till then,</strong> be of good courage, and know you are loved.
