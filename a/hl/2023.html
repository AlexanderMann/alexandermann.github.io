<p>
  <strong>For some eagled-eyed observers,</strong> you&#39;ll note that this isn&#39;t coming out till…holy shit, 2025. Really thought I’d hit publish here, butttttttt…I definitely didn’t. What follows from here on was written in 2023/early 2024.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&quot;How can this be, Alex?!&quot;</strong> I hear you exclaim. Well, this year was the busiest yet. But more importantly, I wanted to be able to write about the wedding celebration that Natalie and I had at the end of January! More on that shortly. With that, 2023:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>In August we said goodbye to Wisconsin.</strong> Truly a wonderful state. Madison was the last &quot;port&quot; we called home. Natalie and I have often thought about how we were just hitting our stride in our final months there. I had multiple (some problematic) nicknames with the local cyclist folks: Champagne Alex, and Cake Alex are the two we&#39;ll share here. The bartenders at the brewery we&#39;d haunt on occasion were asking after us to our friends some months later. We&#39;d finally gotten invited to the secret sauna on the Yahara river. We knew more people than not on our block, with folks asking for everything from sugar to a hand unloading their discount cabinetry from a packed UHaul at 10pm on a weekday during the worst of the wildfire smoke... And our friends were, to a fault, some incredibly kind and solid folks.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Natalie&#39;s curatorial career</strong> took us to Washington, DC. She is now a fellow with the Smithsonian American Art Museum. DC is a place close to family and some of our oldest friends. I&#39;ve already managed a bike trip up to Philadelphia, and to make a name for our household on the block as the &quot;dinosaur house&quot;.

<p>
  <strong>We&#39;ve been fortunate</strong> that our neighbourhood (all credit to Natalie) is packed with interesting folks. The listserv for our block is quite active, and are pretty much the only emails I read on time.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Natalie</strong> managed to nab every fellowship and accolade she applied for last year. This also conveniently meant she was gone most of the summer...while some of us packed for the upcoming move.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Jules</strong> is &quot;mostly&quot; cancer free in 2023. She underwent chemo in late 2022, and pulled through with flying colours. Her coat is back, and no longer stubbly/brittle. She&#39;s pretty much the same old dog.

  <strong>In September,</strong> I tackled the Triple Crown in Vancouver, BC, and then a week later the Sea to Sky Highway. Some of my best friends got me out there, and I just barely managed to &quot;keep up&quot; on my steel bike.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>While</strong> in Vancouver, we did a race called the Vancouver Fondo. Great team, thoughhhhhh...we named the team when we thought Jules was in worse shape. In hindsight, calling the team the "Jules Mann Memorial Ride" was <em>definitely</em> funny, but maybe inappropriate.

  <strong>My brother Bryan</strong> has been kind enough to take our car under his wing. It&#39;s no longer being looked after by the least car-caring-about-people ever, but instead by a man with many non-functioning vehicles (mostly joking). Bryan resides here in the DMV and we get to see him and his partner Bryn pretty much weekly. Bryn graduated from LSE this past year! Bryan has been getting used to her wanting to spend so much time with him. Bryan&#39;s big news has been participating in a very prestigious masters program through John&#39;s Hopkins, and acceptance into Test Pilot Flight School later this year. He&#39;ll be leaving us for California again here in a few months.

  <strong>Charley</strong> is maybe the kindest, funniest person we know. He and his partner Ashley have been making a nice home out of Philadelphia. We don&#39;t know how long they&#39;ll be there, but we&#39;ve been enjoying visiting from time to time. The two of them give the best, most thoughtful gifts.

  <strong>My mother&#39;s</strong> biggest news (according to Natalie) is that she officiated Natalie&#39;s wedding celebration, and did a great job. Her gift to us was flying all of my siblings (extended as well), nieces and nephews to the celebration. Getting to have everyone in the same space for a family reunion of sorts was such a cherished moment.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The celebration</strong> itself coined the term “romantic” in our household forevermore. Bryan at some point, noticed that when Natalie says “romantic” it seems to correlate with the word “expensive”. The entire event was filled with incredible outfits (lots of velvet, and dark florals), laughter, and of course libations. My contribution to the event was baking all of the cakes (seven 2 tier chocolate cakes, 10 lbs of icing, and 3 meringue based chocolate cakes), and folding a boutineer/corsage for everyone who attended the event. Yes, folded. We did origami florals for myself and groomsmen (Bryan and Charley), and all guests (~150 roses, 90 lilies).

  <strong>To my friends,</strong> you know who you are, be of good courage and know you are loved.
