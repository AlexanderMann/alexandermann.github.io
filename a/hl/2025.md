# 2025 Holiday Letter

Natalie and I have been debating about how to start this letter. The start is, in fact, the hardest part. The mechanics of the middle are dead simple: headers for each event (or family member), fill those in, toss in some photos (and in recent years include "reject" (read: Alex approved, but not Natalie approved) photos at the end). But maybe this is apt, because for us, the start of 2025 was difficult.

It began with great loss and great joy. At 1am, after ringing in the New Year with smooches, friends, and a Beatles singalong, we got a phone call from our friend and neighbour [Kim](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/16/terminal-cancer-diagnosis-palliative-care/). We knew immediately what this call meant. Her husband, [Alec](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/legacyremembers/alec-dubro-obituary?id=57314922), had passed away. Thirty seconds later, and we were sitting together sharing stories, waiting for the rabbi to arrive, and taking in a moment that taught us so much about life and love. It was easily one of the greatest honours anyone could ever bestow upon us. A weird beginning in an ending, but loving, joyous, and awe-inspiring nonetheless.

Seven months later, and [Kim](https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2025/07/25/kim-fellner/) had also passed. She was surrounded by the most loving family anyone could ever ask for and in the sanctity of her own home. Kim and Alec were both truly extraordinary people. You should do yourself the favour of reading both of their obit's (Kim, Alec), and especially Kim's sendoff series in the [Washington Post: Living with Dying](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/16/terminal-cancer-diagnosis-palliative-care/).

> Intimacy is not accidental

When we moved to DC in 2023, Kim greeted us and got us on the listserv. She was the matriarch of the block. Since I was in the middle of practicing two cake recipes for our Second Wedding, I was able to send her off with slices in tow. Thankfully, they were good slices, because a quick, easy, and deep friendship ensued. In one of her Washpo op-eds about carjacking in DC, she took a brief aside to dub me the "baking ambassador" (a title that puts me into a long line of ambassadors on Natalie's side of the family). We lived at 522; Kim and Alec lived at 521–we frequently waved to each other from our living rooms. Still to this day, we're humbled at how they spent the time to build such a beautiful friendship with us when they had such a limited amount to spend.

Soon after Kim's funeral, we spoke with her family about the possibility of buying Kim and Alec’s home. A month later, we had closed on 521. I'll leave the update on 521 (a new header in the mechanical part of the letter) for later, but suffice it to say, we have big shoes to fill (Kim was not even 5' ironically) and have been excited by the challenge. We love our neighbourhood and our community. Our sincere hope is that everyone finds their block matriarch, baking ambassador, and community, and works on building something together, instead of tearing things down alone.

And, with that, 2025...

## 521

![Little investigations](../../img/2025/521-how-it-started.jpg)

So, we now have a ~lot more debt~ and a ~brand new~ 1912 house! We are living in the basement (or what we call “mole mode”) and renovations are in full swing. 

Alex could arguably not be happier. He’s had the chance to level up so many of his skills, and to learn a ton of new things. It’s even been an opportunity to collaborate with his “Uncle Buck” (Steve), without whom literally none of this would be possible. With his help, Alex is building the kitchen cabinets! And Alex even got to tick off an item from his bucket list—a Wolf induction stove (“ooooo” “aaahhhh”). But what might not have occurred to him is that all of the other appliances now need to match…

![Too loud](../../img/2025/earmuffs.jpg)

As Alex goes deeper and deeper into projects, Natalie could arguably be happier. There's a very strong argument for this in fact. But he has made mole mode very cozy for her and Jules. 

## Halloween: Cone Heads

![Beam me up](../../img/2025/flying-saucer-astronaut.jpg)

We were fully moved in on October 1st. Not wanting to let down our public, Alex quickly got to work on building just what he'd threatened to do the whole year: a full size flying saucer, suspended in midair. Natalie provided our costumes (sadly not one for Jules) and the Cone Heads had returned to planet Earth. We handed out around 600 pieces of candy this year, and we got lots of fun reactions to the decorations.

![Cone Heads and the Terrifier](../../img/2025/cone-heads.jpg)

One little boy was dressed as [Goku](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eMAtSpOy3sY), and had picked his hair out to be in the shape of a Sayan. He walked up, stood in front of the flying saucer, and then made his parents film him as he told the camera how the Sayans had invaded Earth, and he must stop them.

One of our new neighbours (moved to the block in August/September), was telling Alex in early October about how the decorations in the broader neighbourhood were really impressive, and how there was good competition on the block. Alex simply responded "no." Thank god Alex now has such a healthy outlet like a house to work on instead of planning out what to do for next year's Halloween (designs are already in the works).

## The 24

Milwaukee and the Green Life Chafing/Racing Co. are doing just swell. For the 4th year in a row, Alex got to participate in the Riverwest 24. With a large enough crew, this year we fielded 2 full teams. Great group of folks, and just the best mental reset in the middle of the year.

## Travel

![DAR to LHR](../../img/2025/fuck-this-is-far.jpg)

There was possibly too much travel in 2025. But maybe the “coolest” trip was in June, when Nat and Alex went to visit family in Tanzania and London! This was Natalie’s first time on the African continent. The Tanzania side included exploring Dar Es Salam, staying on the beach in Zanzibar, doing a safari, and not getting malaria or dengue fever (looking at you, Harriet!). There was even a leopard on the safari! 

![Queen's Tennis Club](../../img/2025/queens-tennis.jpg)

We saw dear dear friends in London and Natalie got to show Alex some fun things from her time there like attending the Queen’s Tennis Club pre-Wimbledon tournament and seeing great theater. Natalie was in heaven. Heaven! On one notable day, Natalie planned a walking trip out to Sissinghurst to see the famous gardens (which were outrageously beautiful). But the notable part came at the very end when a friendly stranger named Clive picked up a sad-looking couple from the side of the road in his Land Rover complete with border terrier Bella in tow when they really needed a lift back to the train station and there were no cabs to be found. Thank you, Bella & Clive!

## Natalie

![Birthday Nat](../../img/2025/bday.jpg)

Continuing her string of high profile accomplishments, Natalie wrapped up her fellowship with the Smithsonian this year by getting a Luce/ACLS Dissertation Fellowship and office space at the Library of Congress’ Kluge Center where she can walk to work. She assures Alex that she is writing as fast as she can to finish her PhD. 

Amongst all of these work and life events she has even found time to continue avoiding the dentist.

## Alex

![Mustache meet water buffalo](../../img/2025/mustache-car.jpg)

Alex is in his fifth (soon to be sixth) year at Apollo and doing an awesome job as a senior manager. He loves strategizing about opportunities for his team and making a great work culture. Besides being dubbed the baking ambassador, he is also known as “the arts and crafts manager” at work because amongst other things his origami gifts to staff are off the charts.

He can tell his coworkers apart.*️⃣

*️⃣ _Natalie made me put this joke in. If you get this joke, I am so so sorry on behalf of humanity._

## The Good Professor

What a big doggy year. Six states, two provinces, and two houses. She has been a trooper. Jules is in good spirits and health. She's made a bunch of new dog friends (a big deal for our somewhat canine-averse pooch) and her cancer seems to be mostly leaving her alone. We can’t believe that she’s eleven years old! Her favourite trip was to Fripp Island, SC, where she got all the beach time she could ever want. 

## Family

Bryan got engaged, Charley got 2 cats (Mapo and Miso), Sharmon is happily employed with his first job as a cashier at a grocery store, Natalie's parents upstaged us by buyin a new house of their own (from a Prime Minister too!), and Mom and Tom are still hosting parties of massive scale (including Thanksgiving in their modest apartment in Montreal for: Charley's girlfriends entire family, Natalie's parents, all of us, and of course random strays).

## Onwards...

Hope you enjoy the "reject" photos. Couldn't be more thrilled to continue this tradition.

Be of good courage, and know you are loved.

Alex, Nat, & 🐾
