  <strong>Well, it's the end of the year:</strong> so long 2020! I've been
  holding off on writing about this past year for a number of reasons,
  most easily boiled down to just a general blurgh feeling about the year.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  <strong>Since</strong> I last wrote one of these, a lot has obviously
  happened. There are probably a lot of news stories from this past year
  which have either made you numb to the world, or to which you feel no
  connection whatsoever. As we enter a new year, I would encourage you to
  take a night every so often to open yourself up, and challenge your
  status quo of thinking. To help, I've made a short list of the terms I
  personally am trying to open myself up to, or am working to continue
  learning and working toward a better future on:
</p>

<h4>A Petite List:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Black Lives Matter:</strong> The death of George Floyd served
    as a wake up call to many. For some, it served as continued evidence
    of whatever stance they had already taken. For me personally, I work
    with a young black child via Big Brothers Big Sisters. This has been
    one of the most rewarding experiences in my life. It is tough to work
    out what our mixed race relationship should ideally look like. I have
    struggled with this for some time, and the events of this year have
    prompted me to set goals for myself to continue learning, and working,
    toward a more anti-racist future. I do this partially for myself, but
    largely for this youth, who does not deserve to grow up and inherit
    the world he surely will.<br />
    A good starting point might be to try attending a local meeting of:
    <a
      href="https://www.showingupforracialjustice.org/chapters-and-affiliates.html"
      >SURJ</a
    >
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>The Pandemic:</strong> This is a shared experience like none
    other. It has been incredibly easy to become completely numb to the
    death, and economic toil this has placed on many. I know there are
    many conflicting sources out there on how we best help out in this
    time. Natalie and I have been doing our best to use our privilege to
    shelter at home, and to do as much as possible online (even grocery
    shopping, which has personally killed me as I <em>adore</em> in store
    shopping). This isn't for everyone, and I get it.<br />
    Something tangible you can do in your community is donate to a local
    food pantry. This is something you'd probably be told you "should do"
    even when it wasn't the end-of-times.<br />Not sure where to donate?
    <a href="https://www.feedingahc.org/?form=givenow">Feeding America</a>
    is an organization we've done work with before, and would support
    their mission.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Immigration:</strong> The immigration policies that the
    previous US government administration deployed have wreaked havoc and
    caused significant pain. Without going into detail, I assure you that
    you have loved ones, and simply folks around you who are more affected
    by this more than you know.<br /><a
      href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=4665#group-330"
      >Charity Navigator</a
    >
    is a great place to find mission driven causes, who are putting your
    money to good work.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Climate Change:</strong> It is hard to rank these issues, but
    this one is certainly critical. I'm still vegetarian, and continue to
    eat meat once a month as a form of moderation and so that I can still
    enjoy many of the dishes that I crave from time to time. Wherever you
    land on this issue, I would imagine that protecting the environment is
    at least a more palatable idea.<br />Again, there are a bunch of ways
    to help with this. I'm going to point you to
    <a
      href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=6890"
      >Charity Navigator</a
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So,</strong> with that out of the way: The personal news...</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  <strong>Since</strong> last writing, we said goodbye to my grandmother.
  I had assumed this time last year, that this would be the thing which
  ate up the majority of my letter this year. My grandmother Janet was one
  of two of the most influential teachers I had in my life (grandpa being
  the other). She was quirky, and cooky, and rough around the edges, but
  she is also the person who taught me how to use colour, draw, sculpt,
  and to create. Her eye for anything graphic, was almost second to none.
  She also had a, often painfully annoying, candor to her. She would tell
  you what was wrong with whatever you did no matter the
  circumstances...nor present company. She will be missed.

</p>

<p>
  <strong>Natalie's</strong> big news this year, is probably what should
  be my biggest news too. After about 8 years of dating and a brief
  engagement, we are now officially married. I regret to inform everyone
  that nothing has really changed between us day to day, other than I now
  have my first tattoo. Seriously, Nat was already wearing her engagement
  ring for the last handful of years on her left hand because "this is the
  only finger this family heirloom will fit on". Our ceremony was us, my
  brother Charley, our dear friend Dakota (who is also an
  <a href="https://www.dakotamace.com/">unreal photographer</a>), and our
  Judge
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoAnne_Kloppenburg"
    >JoAnne Kloppenburg</a
  >. It was held on August 21st, in the Arboretum here. Natalie wants to
  have another ceremony when the world is less on fire.

  <strong>Natalie</strong> is here laying on the ground playing with the
  dog's jowls and is upset I forgot to include anything about her big
  scholarship news. She also received the
  <a
    href="https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/results-resultats/recipients-recipiendaires/2019/cgs_doctoral-besc_doctorat-eng.aspx"
    >highly prestigious version of the SSHRC scholarship from the Canadian
    Government</a
  >. The actual name of this scholarship is about the same length of this
  paragraph, so for everyone's sake, I have omitted it.

<p>
  <strong>Momas and Thomas</strong> are doing their thing in New
  Brunswick. Now ordained, and installed as a minister <i>in Canada</i> my
  mother has more problems than just dealing with my brothers and I. We
  have yet to see any reprieve from attention (nagging) due to this. We
  remain ever hopeful. Tom's big news at one point was that he got a green
  screen to "help with the remote teaching/sermons".

  <strong>Bryan</strong> is still a coastal elite, though he is now living
  in DC. He continues to hold true to the hobbies which make him him. Crap
  tons of LEGO, a mostly impractical car (but cool), cooking, film/TV, and
  griping about whatever. He is still a rocket scientist, and tall. Last
  Christmas, I coordinated getting him a Nintendo Switch, and some video
  games as the single gift <i>everyone</i> in the family got him. He
  didn't say thank you, but he did say: "this is so cool."

<p>
  <strong>Charley,</strong> or as Natalie, Jules and I call him, our
  ex-roommate, is living happily in Pittsburgh taking on a new job for
  Housing and Urban Development. Charley kept us company for a few months
  when he was suddenly evacuated from his Peace Corps position in South
  Africa. We now share a lot of inside jokes about mayonnaise, the
  midwest, water, tofu, and jam. Charley helped up through some pretty
  tricky months, and we are so proud of where he is now!
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The</strong>
  <a href="http://www.bbbsmilwaukee.org/">Little Brother</a> has had a
  trying, but successful year. Obviously, learning from home has been a
  challenge, but he has requested tutoring, and so we work on that a
  handful of times every week. His latent math skills are still shining
  (when he so chooses) and a new talent for musical theory. He was able to
  help me celebrate my 30th birthday over some ice cream, along with
  getting to see my newly minted tattoo (my ring while Natâ€™s is measured
  in carats).

  <strong>Jules</strong> is also good! We find out her DNA soon! So far we
  think she is 90% coward, 10% warrior; 99% couch potato, 1% swimmer; 80%
  salmon (dog food), 20% charcoal (breath treats); 33% horse, 33% pig, 33%
  butterball turkey; etc. Our hope is that in 2021, we can all simply be
  dogs.
