<p><strong>Hello</strong> all,</p>

<p>
  <strong>So</strong> this is a tradition that my mother has been doing for many
  many years and that I have come to find myself itching to pick up. Don’t worry
  though, my holiday letter will be objectively worse than the listings of some
  crazed woman trapped with a tyrannical cat. My mother was foolish enough to
  raise myself and my brothers to an age where we could buy fireworks, alcohol,
  and cable television legally. But, somewhere over the years this early ritual
  rubbed off on me. Hope you enjoy the read, even if it is worse.

  <strong>Last</strong> year I left Dayton, Ohio for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
  I packed up my bags and moved into a cockroach infested apartment in Chinatown
  (never eat food that comes from around 11th and Arch, pro-tip). Less than two
  weeks later, I was able to move into the place I am still at now. I did not
  know it at the time, but the man I ended up living with would become one of my
  dear friends, and would introduce me to an even better friend (for the two
  that are reading, I just ranked you).

  <strong>In</strong> the summer I travelled to Bermuda, and was able to
  celebrate Cup-Match. Highlights from this trip are as follows: bikinis, Amstel
  Light and Twisted Tea, bioluminescent algae, poached eggs and mimosas,
  Cricket(…?), watching a stranger microwave their brand new iPhone, assigning
  everyone an animal spirit that starts with the first letter of their name,
  watching a good friend die then come back to life with only minor brain
  bleeding (he’s engaged now!).

  <strong>For</strong> Thanksgiving, ironically, we had as many Canadians attend
  as we did ‘Muricans. My grandfather’s highlight of our surprise visitors from
  North of the Border was “the one who put his fork at the top of the plate of
  turkey, and slid it all on his plate”. Everyone else’s favourite part was my
  grandfather’s “corn-squeezins.”

  <strong>Like</strong> the majority of my generation, I have taken up rock
  climbing and have found a lot of pleasure in the practice thereof. Most of the
  friends I’ve made while climbing have always let me down.

  <strong>It</strong> was in May of this past year that I surprised Natalie (3
  years now) with a ten second snapchat depicting a small pit-mix with the
  caption “meet the latest addition.” 6 months later and we still have Professor
  Juliette Henrietta Wagstaff, Dogtorate in Osteology from Canis Cannes, living
  with us. She has been a energetic, kind dog with a distinct affection for
  swimming, cuddling, and pooping on the kitchen floor when the dishwasher is
  running. Natalie’s mom thinks she is ugly.

  <strong>To</strong> celebrate her completion of her masters and the union of
  two of our dear friends, Natalie and I flew off to LA. The wedding for Eva and
  James was gorgeous, taking place at the Rancho Santa Anna Botanic Garden. The
  after party was able to be held under the stars, we got to meet many many
  characters from the bride and groom's families, and Natalie even got to be
  included in the "people who have been to prison" photo! After the festivities
  died down, Nat and I had two extra days in LA. They were spent eating
  "concrete ice cream" and Mexican cuisine, hiking Mount Baldy, and swimming in
  the Pacific Ocean.

  <strong>This</strong> past summer I received a further responsibility as a
  “tech lead” (valley mumbo jumbo) from my employer (RJMetrics.com/about). The
  company itself has over tripled in size since I started. Even with the crazy
  amounts of hours I end up putting in (because I honestly enjoy it), I still
  have time to make things like bicycle-frame tables, various prints, and NBA
  draft predictors. In this next year I hope to find more time for reviving my
  musical musings, and my attempts at “art.”

  <strong>As</strong> far as the people in my life go: Charley (youngest,
  tallest brother) is doing a radio show now which is actually pretty great! He
  visited this past summer in Philly and was a pleasure to have around. I’m
  still sorry for him that he got stood up on a date after I recommended him a
  coffee shop in Philly. Bryan (middle, shorter brother) worked for NASA (I
  still cannot believe those words are actually in a sentence together), and is
  applying for PhD programs abroad (again, in a sentence). My mother (Susan) is
  still insane, but loved. Her cat is like her parents: alive, but distorting
  reality into visions of their own grandeur. The Canadian half of our family
  (my mother’s boyfriend of almost a decade’s family) is doing quite well.
  Luckily for Bryan, Charley, and myself, they are spitting out babies left and
  right, so Susan (who is literally referred to as “Grandpa Susan” by their
  family) is appeased. Natalie is also doing very well. Her visa arrived safe
  and sound, she is decompressing from two very intense years of grad school, is
  working on brand strategy for museums and cultural institutions (and figuring
  out her professional dreams), and is baking a hell of a lot of bread (she
  totally did not write that). She also made her first Lego kit at the age of
  23...

<p>
  <strong>There</strong> will be more to come, but it’ll have to wait till I see
  you in person. As always, to those of you who are my friends, you know who you
  are.
</p>

<p>Cheers, Alex</p>
