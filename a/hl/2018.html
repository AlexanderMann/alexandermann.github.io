        <strong>If</strong> you've found your way here, take a spell and enjoy a
        tale of 2018...
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The</strong> closeout to
        <a href="./2017.html">2017 (since we last talked)</a> was a mixture of
        excitement and tumult. In the excitement camp, we had our annual
        pilgrimage to Dayton Ohio for the Turkey Trot and Thanksgiving. Even
        more of our extended family was able to join us. Also on the pros, I
        spent my first Christmas with Natalie's family up in Quebec! I brought
        cherry birdhouses as gifts for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>

          alt="Cherry birdhouse"
          title="Fancy AF"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>On</strong> the tumult, we lost my grandfather in his battle
        with cancer. My grandfather was a pillar in my life, and I cannot
        imagine the person I would be without his guidance. His memorial was
        packed with friends and family, a community outpouring.
      </p>

          title="There are many traits I wish to inherit from my grandfather...just not his hair..."
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Later</strong> in the year we also said goodbye to Natalie's
        grandmother at 96 years. She was a true testament to willpower. Finally,
        my aunt's parents passed just a little while back. All of them were
        larger than life characters who never ceased to leave us with a story.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>To</strong> all of these people, you will be dearly missed, but
        carried on in so many ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>To</strong> clear the gloom, here's a picture of dear Proffessor
        Wagstaff!
      </p>

        />
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Nat</strong> in the last year has been published more, spoken
        more, and is prepping her first solo curated show. All in all she's
        balancing her professional success and her ability to be an adult. She
        has more or less officially lost the ability to cook. Myself and others
        are more and more convinced that she is intentionally sabotaging the
        tasks she's given so that she won't be asked to do them. Most recently
        "how do I cook rice?" Similarly with the dog, she is happy to provide
        emotionally, but has officially made a joke out of helping to
        bathe/clean/etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>In</strong> May I traveled to Atlanta to consume tacos, roti,
        barbeque, and boba tea... Bryan and Charley also graduated from Georgia
        Tech and Emory respectively.
      </p>

          title="The woman operating the photo booth couldn't comprehend why we were so happy when she told us she couldn't adjust the camera height."
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Bryan</strong> no longer has to pretend to be a coastal elite,
        having now officially moved to LA. He would claim this is for his job
        doing "space force shite", but he only moved there <i>after</i> Lebron.
        Suspect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Charley's</strong>
        summer post graduation was spent continuing to help area refugees in
        Atlanta. He was accepted into a fellowship and his final presentation
        was accepted as the new standard for the program. His other job was
        modeling the cycling caps I made.

      <p>
        <strong>The</strong> other younger brother and only
        <a href="http://www.bbbsmilwaukee.org/">Little Brother</a> has been a
        pleasure to spend time with. Highlights from his first year as a little
        Mann:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>feeding Jules homemade blue slime</li>
        <li>
          a dinner prepared for Natalie and I all on his own (chopping peppers,
          boiling pasta, balsamic vinaigrette added to the sauce, fried cheese
          on meatballs... some assistance with some of these things...)
        </li>

        <li>
          figuring out negative numbers all on his own (this was an especially
          amazing moment for me, as you could almost literally see the gears
          clicking as he realized in his brain the other half of the number
          line)
        </li>

        <li>free tickets to a Milwaukee Bucks game because of his haircut</li>
      </ul>

      <p>

          alt="Mom, Tom, Mounty"
          title="That mounty still swears one of them grabbed his bum."
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The</strong> new sibling editions are all doing spectacularly.
        Their dad is now allowed back into the US (he had gone back and forth
        across the border too much), which is nice! Mother dearest is finishing
        up at school and will soon be able to wield the voice of God. I presume.
        Grandmother is also doing well. She's participated in an art show this
        year and is busy nagging us all from her perch.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>As</strong> for myself, I'm still cooking, climbing, cycling,
        and in general creating. As I'm writing this I'm currently (f)unemployed
        having resigned from my previous job. The opportunities afforded due to
        this "free" time have been enormous and I can hardly wait to wake up
        each day due to the possibilities! Making hats, shoes, internet
        companies, recipes, training the dog to jump over bicycles, blah blah
        blah.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>With</strong> that, we look forward to another year and the
        chance to see everyone soon.
      </p>

      <p><strong>To</strong> my friends, you know who you are.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Cheers</strong>,<br />
        Alex
