## 📓 Notes on salad dressing in _general_

First, some useful reading on all things that make up a successful salad dressing:

- 🔗 [Serious Eats' guide to vinegar](https://www.seriouseats.com/serious-eats-guide-to-vinegars)
- 🔗 [Serious Eats' guide to vinaigrettes and salad dressings](https://www.seriouseats.com/salad-dressings-vinaigrettes-the-food-lab)

Lastly, from [J.

## If you're Shara and reading this

So you asked me a ridiculous question at Natalie's birthday party. Namely, "what do you put your [family's relish recipe](./chow-chow-piccalili-relish.md) with?" Ie, "hey man, you gave me this jar of mystery pickles, how the heck do I eat it?"

For my family, there are only 2 answers:

1. Deviled Eggs
2. Egg Salad

It never even occurred to me that there were other things folks would _need_ to put it with, because surely, you wouldn't have enough left over for anything else. Simply put, my family eats a _lot_ of eggs + relish.

The only inkling I had that there were other things folks would put this relish with was from my grandmother's handmade cookbook. It suggests "to add to salads, salsa, meats." However, this is the same cookbook that recommends some rather dated recipes from the midwest (Dayton Dip, Hamburger Cookies, Ham Loaf, everything casseroled) so my trust in this recommendation was incredibly low.

Since you asked me that question though, I've been trying to add the relish to various dishes, looking for places it might actually shine. Thus was born this recipe for a pretty solid salad dressing. Definitely on the sweet spectrum, though a lot of that can be tempered with what mustard you choose.

In short, thank you for challenging me, even if it does mean I have less relish for eggs. 🥚

## Ingredients

> Ratios that follow are really rough, this is honestly just guess/check and to taste. Maybe I'll update this again someday 🤷‍♂️

- 1/2 part: Mustard (Stadium Yellow mustard works great)
- 1/2 part: Agave syrup/honey
- 2 parts: [Chow Chow Piccalili Relish](./chow-chow-piccalili-relish.md)
    - Optional: Additional white vinegar (the juice leftover from the relish works really well here, has more flavour to it)

## Directions

Chuck it all in a container, and shake

📓 I like to use the last bits of agave or mustard in its container, and then flush the container out by making dressing _in it_
