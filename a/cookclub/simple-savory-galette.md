## Ingredients</h2>

- prepared puff pastry (or croissants in a tube 😝)
- container Boursin
- 1 medium onion
- 2-3 bulbs garlic
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 cups cherry tomatoes
- (optional) prosciutto as an additional topping
- sea salt to finish

## Directions

1. ❗️ **Important:** Keep your dough in the fridge till you're ready to assemble!
2. 🎛️ Preheat oven to 350

### 🔪 Prep the vegetables:

1. 🧅 Julianne onions, set aside in a bowl
2. 🧄 Crush garlic, add to the bowl with the onions
3. 🍅 Halve the tomatoes, set aside
4. 🍳 In a pan, set over medium heat, caramelize the onions and garlic with a healthy pinch of salt

### 🏗️ Assemble:

1. 🧑‍🍳 On a baking sheet, unroll your puff pastry
2. 📓 Note: If you have croissants in a tube, you're doing little mini galettes. Unroll each, and lay flat
3. 🧀 Spread the Boursin onto your puff pastry, leaving a 1-2 inches on the edges
4. Next add your caramelized onions in a thin layer
5. Finally add cherry tomatoes, cut side up, and if using prosciutto add sparingly

#### Fancy little eges

1. ❗️ Fold the edges of your dough up so that you have a nice little border
2. 🎥 [For an example, watch how Claire Saffitz does this, she's the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLxGcFr93TM&t=870s)
3. 📓 If your dough has gotten a little warm, simply place everything in the fridge for 10-15 minutes

### 🔥 Cook!

1. Place in oven for 45-55 minutes, till nicely browned
2. 🍽️ Enjoy!
