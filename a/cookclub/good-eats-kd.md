In Alton Brown's hit TV Show Good Eats, few episodes are more memorable to me than ["For Whom the Cheese Melts, 2](https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/good-eats/episodes/for-whom-the-cheese-melts-2). No doubt this is because I watched it when it aired in 2002 I was an impressionable child. Seeing one of my favourite foods broken down "scientifically" was a big deal. It added a level of sophistication and legitimacy to it.

This recipe is almost entirely cribbed from [here](https://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/best-ever-mac-and-cheese-60408).

- Time: 40 mins</li>

## Ingredients

- 1/2 pound elbow macaroni
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 2 eggs
- 6 ounces evaporated milk
- 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- Fresh black pepper
- 3/4 teaspoon dry mustard
- 10 ounces sharp cheddar, shredded

## Directions

1. In a large pot of boiling, salted water cook the pasta to al dente and drain. Return to the pot and melt in the butter. Toss to coat.
2. Whisk together the eggs, milk, hot sauce, salt, pepper, and mustard. Stir into the pasta and add the cheese. Over low heat continue to stir for 3 minutes or until creamy.
