This recipe is adapted from J. Kenji López-Alt's recipe which
[can be found in full here](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-roast-potatoes-ever-recipe).

This recipe strips out a couple of steps which are...truly incredible, and delicious, but in our household, ketchup is going to be used regardless, and _not_ using Montreal steak spice with potatoes seems like a sin. We also don't mind the skins on our potatoes, so we skip peeling too.

Additionally, this is half the size of the original recipe since some of our family members have less self control.

- Cook: 100 mins
- Active: 30 mins
- Total: 100 mins

## Ingredients

- Kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon (2g) baking soda
- 2 pounds (about 1 kg) russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into roughly 1" chunks
- 2 1/2 tablespoons (37ml) extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp (10g) Montreal steak spice

## Directions

1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) (or 400°F (200°C) if using convection). Heat a quart (1L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add 1 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1/2 ounce; 13g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.
2. When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully into a colander and let them rest for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Add olive oil, and steak spice to the pot you were just cooking in. Toss potatoes back into the pot, and toss to coat, shaking roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.

3. Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.
4. Serve immediately.
