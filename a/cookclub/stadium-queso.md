This recipe was largely cribbed from [Rainbow Plant Life](https://rainbowplantlife.com/the-best-vegan-queso-ever/)

An addictively good yet extremely easy cheese sauce that tastes just like queso. Less than 10 ingredients and everything happens in a blender. Use it in burritos, quesadillas, tacos, or nachos, or warm it up and serve as a hot queso dip with tortilla chips!</p>

## Notes

There are only really 3 or 4 "special" ingredients to make this:

- cashews
- greek yogurt
- pickled jalapeños
- nutritional yeast

## Ingredient

<ul>
- 1 cup raw cashews
- 1/2 cup plain greek yogurt
- 1/2 cup of your favorite salsa
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- Several cracks of freshly cracked black pepper
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 2 tablespoons pickled jalapeños + 2 tablespoons of the pickled jalapeño brine
- Kosher salt or sea salt to taste

## Directions

1. Add the raw cashews to a saucepan. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes. Let soak overnight.
2. Drain the cashews.
3. Add the drained cashews to a blender/food processor. Add the yogurt, salsa, water, cumin, chili powder, paprika, black pepper, nutritional yeast, pickled jalapeños, and pickled jalapeño brine.
4. Blend until thick, creamy, and smooth. Taste for seasonings, adding salt as needed.
   - This may take as much as 5-10 minutes depending on what kind of blender/food processor you have

📓 **Note:** the pickled jalapeños are decently salty, so I don't add much salt, but if you skip them, be sure to add salt (1/2 to 1 teaspoon kosher salt).

To serve warm, add the queso to a small saucepan and gently heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 8 minutes. If it seems too thick, add a splash of milk or water and stir to incorporate.
