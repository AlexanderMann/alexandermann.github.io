This was my grandmother's recipe (it needs some updating, especially on quantity 😅). It was handed down to her by her mother, and probably her grandmother. The name "Piccalili" we _think_ comes from _Piccadilly_ and possibly a similar relish our family encountered, or maybe brought with them to the states? No one left around who knows now 🤷‍♂️.

## Ingredients

- 3 gallon green tomatoes ~1 bushel
- 2 lg. heads of cabbage
- 6 lbs onions
- Bell peppers
    - 6 green
    - 6 red
    - 6 yellow
- 2 1/2 C canning salt
- Water
- 12 1/2 C Sugar
- 2 box celery seed
- 2 box mustard seed
- 1 gallon 5% white vinegar
- 36 pint jars (or equivalent) for canning

## Directions

1. Place ingredients in food processor, and chop to a fine consistency
1. Place in large stock pot to brine.
1. Add canning salt and water to cover
1. Stir well, place covered in a cool place for up to 3 weeks, no less than 1 week

### ⏳...⌛️

1. Start prepping your canning supplies and proceed with next steps
1. Rinse and drainwell, placing pulp back into the pot
1. Add sugar, seeds, and vinegar, bring to a rolling boil
1. 🚨 **While everything is hot:** Fill each jar ~1/2 inch from the top of jar, and seal.
    - If you aren't hearing the jars pinging, you're probably in for botulism
