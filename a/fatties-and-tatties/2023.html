  Well, if you like people, or just potatoes, feel free to come by for
  some banter!
</p>
<p>
  ...if you don&#39;t like any of those things, you might just be a bad
  person?

  As of this year, we&#39;re not going to be providing any group bikes.
  We&#39;re sure there&#39;ll be some folks around, who&#39;ll let you try
  their bike out, but you should prolly plan on finding yourself a bike if
  you want one.

  🧐 Seriously tho, what is this, and how did this get started?

<p>
  In 2021, we were all going nuts from the Pandemic, and decided, that in the middle
  of the winter, in Wisconsin, we were going to throw a party that was entirely
  socially distanced, and entirely outside. We made sauces, we ordered 5 Guys, and
  we got a number of local bike shops to rent or loan us fat bikes so that our
  ridiculous group of friends could keep the theme alive.
</p>
<p>
  That's literally it.
