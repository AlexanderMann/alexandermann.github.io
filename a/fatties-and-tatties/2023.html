<p>Well, if you like people, or just potatoes, feel free to come by for some banter!</p>
<p>...if you don&#39;t like any of those things, you might just be a bad person?</p>
<h2 id="😭-but-wait-what-if-i-dont-have-a-bike">😭 But wait, what if I don&#39;t have a bike???</h2>
<p>As of this year, we&#39;re not going to be providing any group bikes. We&#39;re sure there&#39;ll be some
folks around, who&#39;ll let you try their bike out, but you should prolly plan on finding
yourself a bike if you want one.</p>

<p>Because it took a lot of time, energy, and effort (and we drive a small car)...annnnnnnnd
